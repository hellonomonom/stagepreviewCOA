# VR Development Roadmap

## ✅ Phase 1: Complete!

- ✅ Core VR session management
- ✅ Basic head tracking  
- ✅ Scene rendering in VR
- ✅ Optimized launch position
- ✅ UI hiding/showing in VR

---

## 🎯 Phase 2: Enhancements (Recommended Next Steps)

### 1. VR Scale Adjustment ⭐ High Priority

**What:** Allow users to scale the VR experience (zoom in/out)

**Why:** Different users may want to see the stage closer or farther

**Implementation:**
- Add scale slider to settings panel
- Apply scale to VR scene offset
- Range: 0.5x to 2.0x

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes

---

### 2. VR Camera Preset Navigation ⭐ High Value

**What:** Allow users to teleport to different viewing positions

**Why:** Explore the stage from multiple angles

**Implementation:**
- Add preset selector in settings
- Create teleport function
- Smooth position transitions
- Save/load favorite positions

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 3. Performance Optimization 🔧 Important

**What:** Ensure smooth VR performance (72fps+)

**Why:** VR needs higher framerates than desktop

**Implementation:**
- Auto-reduce quality in VR mode
- FPS monitoring
- Dynamic crowd reduction if needed
- Shadow quality adjustments

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

### 4. Controller Support 🎮 Nice to Have

**What:** Basic controller interactions

**Why:** Enable movement and interaction beyond head tracking

**Implementation:**
- Detect controllers (Quest 3, Vision Pro)
- Show controller models
- Basic teleport with controllers
- Scale adjustment via controller

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

## 📋 My Recommendation: Start Here

### Option 1: Scale Adjustment (Easiest Win) ⚡
**Time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Impact:** High  
**Difficulty:** Easy

Perfect for quick improvement!

### Option 2: Camera Presets Navigation (Most Useful) 🎯
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Very High  
**Difficulty:** Medium

Great for exploring the stage!

### Option 3: Performance First (Most Important) 🔧
**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** Critical for smooth experience  
**Difficulty:** Medium

Ensure it runs smoothly before adding features!
